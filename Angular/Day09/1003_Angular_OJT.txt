Today's Lecture Agenda
1 what is Angular => Pratik, 
 - Angular is front end Tech.
 - It is Freamwork developed by google 
 - Angular is used to developed Web Application  as well as cross platform application.
 - Angular is rewritten in typescript 
 - It developed SPA Application to increase your angular performance
 - Angular is component based Architecture.
 - Enterprise Application is design by angular like gmail,flipkart,sbi Mutual funds,ganna.com 
 
2 What is different between Angular Js and Angular => Kunal 
	- Angular js is Js based / Angular is Typescript 
	- it follows MVC pattern / MVW pattern
	- It is Object based lang / It is OOPS based lang 
	- It is memeory management is not appropriate / appropriate memeory management
	- Angular Performance is Decrease / performance is increase 
	- It not support mobile community / it support mobile community 
	
3 What is Key Feature of Angular/Why we use angular / Advantage of Angular? => Harshal 
	
	- It easy to build application with the web 
	- Angular has declarative template,end to end tooling,services ,DI,Module concept
	- It is support all platform as well as cross platform 
	- It is universal freamwork 
	- It is MVW Architecture pattern follow 
	- It has inbuild CLI 
	- It has code splitting functionality.
	- It incerase Speed & performance 
	
4 What is TypeScript  and why it is used in Angular  => vaishali 
	- Typescript is developed by Microsoft
	- Typescript is Superset of Js
	- It is combination of type + script 
		i.e it follows Oops concept & scripting functionality 
	- It conatins ecma Script + JS ecma script version + OOPS Concept + module concept
	- it has compiler that transcompile ur .ts file to js file 
	- It has Strong static typing functionality
	- It shows compile time error
	- It supports OOPS Concept 
	
5 Explain the concept of data binding in angular => damodar 
	1 In data binding u have to send data from component to view i.e it is one way direction so it is called one way data binding
 2 we can display or render data dynamically for that we use data binding
 3 in data binding has 2 types 
	1 one way data binding
	2 two way data binding
	
 - one way data binding direction has 4 technique 
	1 string interpolation => It is Used to render a dynamic data to end user 
	2 property binding => It is Used to bind a property to attribute 
	3 style binding => To apply style dynamically to particular html element 
	4 class binding => To apply Css Classes dynamically to particular html element.
	
- two way data binding
	- To Achieve two way data binding we used ngModel
	- ngModel is attribute directive 
	

6 What are directives in angular? => kanchan 
	Directives in Angular are powerful components that allow you to extend and modify the behavior of HTML elements. They provide a way to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) structure, add interactivity, and dynamically change the appearance or behavior of elements.
	Directives have different type
	1 Attribute directives
		-> ngStyle,ngClass,ngModal 
	2 Structural directives
		1 *ngIf 
		2 *ngFor
		3 *ngSwitch
	3 component directives
		ng-template ,router-outlet
	4 event directives
	onSubmit	
	
7 Difference between structural and attribute directives => deshmukh 
	
8 What is the purpose of ngmodel in angular => Suresh 
	
 - ngmodel is Two way data binding 
 - It is attribute directives
 - For ngmodel we have to import FormsModule into app.module.ts file  and then u can use it in you dom Structure
 - It is used to update data dynamically 
 - It is used in banana in box notation [()] 
 - it is used on any html tag 
 - [(ngModel)]="propertyname" =>
 property we have to create in component file 
	
9 What is the purpose of ngmodule in angular => Swaraj 

- Module is nothing but simple collection of classes, interface,sercices,componet 
- It is a decorator @ngmodule({
		declaration:[],
		import:[], 
		provider:[],
		bootstrap:[AppComponent]
 })
 - it is class level decorator
 - In your angular application one root module is present that is appModule 
 - with the help of ngmodule we can create your own module to used in angular application
 ng g m user --routing 
 - with the help of ngmodule we can achieve lazy loading in routing. 
 
10 How to use event Binding? => pratik 

 - It is one way direction binding
 - it flows data from view file to component file 
 - for that we use event handler to bind a specific event 
 
 
11 Difference Between $Event & template Reference variable
 $event 
    - It is special variable given by angular 
    - It gives current DOM Element Information
    - We can only access a model of that particular element we can not change or manipulate that data 
	- Generally we used $event on component interaction 

template Ref Variable
    - It gives DOM Element information
    - It holds the object / model/handle of particular DOM element 
    - #uniqueName
	- we can use any html tag as wellas on ur selector 
    - we can manipuate data as well as behaviour of element
