		1 declaration : 
			- to register your component 
			- u can register custom pipe 
		2 import 
			- to register ur module or inbuilt module
		3 service =>
		    - It is simple class 
			- To write BL 
			- to register ur service 
			- it gives providers key 
			- with the help of DI we can use that service
		4 Routing
			- navigation from one component to another component
			- u can send a data to component
			- it provide lazy loading 
	- injector 
		- to inject 3rd party service 
		- u can inject inbuilt services as well
